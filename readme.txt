Creates a sidebar widget for the Subscribe2 plugin if you have other plugins that are incompatible with the original Subscribe2 widget.

== Description ==

This plugin is really just a widget to go along with the Subscribe2 plugin.  There is a conflict with some plugins and the widget that comes with the Subscribe2 plugin due to the use of the-content(). See [here](http://subscribe2.wordpress.com/2006/11/16/widget-conflict/).  This widget does not use the-content(), but functions in the same exact way as the original widget.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `subscribe2-widget-hack.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Ensure the Subscribe2 plugin is uploaded and activated
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place the widget in your sidebar in the 'Presentation'->'Widgets' menu in WordPress.
